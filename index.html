Her birthname was <b>Helene Kafka</b>.</p>
    <p class="ipsum-paragraph">Born on 1 May 1894, the sixth daughter of a shoemaker in Husovice in what was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire, she was baptised Helena. When she was two years old, her family moved to Vienna, the capital, and home to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_people" title="Czech people" class="mw-redirect">Czech</a> migrant community, where she grew up. She worked as a salesclerk and then as a nurse at the Lainz public <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital" title="Hospital">hospital</a>.</p>
    <p class="ipsum-paragraph">While working as a nurse, she met the Franciscan Sisters of Christian Charity and entered their community in 1914, at the age of 20. She took the name Restituta after a 4th-century Christian martyr. After the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" title="First World War" class="mw-redirect">First World War</a>, she began working as a nurse at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6dling" title="Mödling">Mödling</a> hospital, eventually becoming the leading surgical nurse.</p>

When the Nazis took over Austria, Sister Restituta was very vocal in her opposition to the new regime. "A Viennese cannot keep her mouth shut", she said. When a new hospital wing was constructed, Sister Restituta hung a crucifix in every room. The Nazis demanded the crosses be taken down and the sister refused. The Nazis demanded that the crosses be removed, threatening Sr Restituta's dismissal. The crucifixes were not removed, nor was Sr Restituta, since her community said they could not replace her.</p>
